# FruitTree
A JTree that supports Drag and Drop, Cut, Copy, Paste, and Undo/Redo.

Born out of the frustration of trying to find an example anywhere that implements all the fruit. This is a more-or-less bare-bones model to build on.

Also includes:
- a friendlier cell editor,
- a toolbar, and
- additional edit actions;
  - Clone, and
  -  Delete.

Props to these folk from whom I shamelessly stole code:
- __Rob Camick__ for Component Border (<a href="https://tips4java.wordpress.com/2009/09/27/component-border">Java Tips WebLog</a> and
 <a href="https://github.com/tips4java/tips4java/blob/main/source/ComponentBorder.java">GitHub</a>), and
- __Albert Hendriks__ <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4588109/drag-and-drop-nodes-in-jtree">Stack Overflow</a> which was in turn code edited from <a href="https://coderanch.com/t/346509/java/JTree-drag-drop-tree-Java">coderanch</a> by
